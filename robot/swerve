#### basics
type of holonomic drive, holonomic meaning all degrees of freedom
requires 8 motors, 4 to pivot, 4 to drive.
traditionally four wheels, each of which can independently pivot and move.

#### advantages
agility: chassis orientation becomes irrelevant, can turn on point
traction: full traction wheels due to pivot
stealth: no need to broadcast intentions
dynamic steering: [TODO: what is this] not necessary 1:1 drive mapping (agility foce multiplier)
servicable: 5 minute module switch

#### disadvantages
thicc: given
complexity: programming is a bitch, modules are not fun either
time: requires a lot of CNC machining
expensive: see prior
straight lines: high precision required
driver training: have to learn control


#### inverse kinematics

#### strats
rotate on def for perpendicular
