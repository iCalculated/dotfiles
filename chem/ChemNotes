#equilibrium
equilibrium: reversible reaction, same rate both ways
-ex N2O4(g) <=> 2NO2(g)
equilibrium constant expression: [Kc] ratio of concentrations wrt to rates
-ex N2O4(g) <=> 2NO2(g) -> Kc = [NO2}^2/[N2O4]
raised to power of order, multiplied by side, reactants/products.
Kp: Kc wrt to partial pressure rather than concentration
Kp = Kc(RT)^{\delta n} st R is the universal gas constant, T is temp in Kelvin and \delta n is the change in nubmer of moles (+1 in the prior reaction)
!pure solids and bases do not get included in calculations
-ex 2H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) = OH-(aq) -> Kc = [H3O+][OH-]
Ksp: solubility process
Ka: wrt acid. acid dissociation constant
Kb: wrt bases
when reactions are added the constants are multiplied

Buffers: solution of weak conjugate acid-base
particularly resistant when strong base or acid added
ph range is the range within which the buffer works

Henderson-Hasselbach:
pH = pKa + log (base)/(acid)

if weak in excess then buffer

#Le Chatelier's Principle
reaction quotient express, Q: same formula as K, but not necc eq conditions.
Kc = Q -> at eq, Kc < Q -> more reactans, Kc > Q -> more products
!if placed in alphabetical order points the right way
Le Chatelier's principle: rules for equilibrium under stress
factors
	increase concentration -> shifts to other side
	increase heat -> favors endothermic side (think of heat as a product)
	decrease in volume -> side with fewer moles (gaseous only)
	catalyst -> *not* a factor, same mechanism can be reversed

-ex 6CO2(g) + 6H2O(l) <=> C6H12O6(s) + 6O2(g), \delta H = 2880 kJ
    CO2 addition -> favors right, yes
    heat increased -> favors right, exothermic side
    vol of system decreased -> no change, same gaseous moles
    oxygen gas removed -> favors left, yes
    glucose removed -> no change, solid, not gas or aq
    catalyst -> no change, both ways
    water removed -> no change, not gas or aq 

#acids and bases
acids have pH < 7, bases pH > 7
acid is strong if fully dissociates, same for base (strong electrolyte)
pH = -log[H+], pH + pOH = 14
kA = [conjugate][H3O+]/[acid]
Kw=KaKb=1 x 10^{-14} = [H3O+][OH-]
multiple for polyprotic acids, kA1, kA2...
Arrhenius: Acid and base by H+ and OH- respectively
Bronstead-Lowry: proton donors vs acceptors

-ex of pH calculation; find pH of following
0.0015 M HNO3 -> 0.0015 M [H+] -> pH=-log(0.0015)=2.822
2.5g NaOH in 500 mL of water -> 2.5 g / 40 g = 0.0625 m OH. pOH = -log(0.125M)=0.9. pH + pOH = 14 -> pH = 13.1 

-ex eq for Ka dissolving HF(aq) in water
Ka = [H3O+][F-]/[HF]

-ex calculate molar concentration of H3O+ in 0.4M HF(aq) (Given Ka = 6.8 * 10^{-4})
Products change by x
6.8 * 10^{-4} = x^2/0.4 -> x = 0.16M = [H3O+] = [F-]

8 strong bases: 
7 strong acids: HI, HBr, HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, HClO3, HClO4
polarity and strength are inversely correlated
weaker/more polar H-X bond -> more acidic

oxyacid: acid containing oxygen
in oxyacids more O -> more acidic
In oxacids, -OH bonded to Y, Y more electronegative -> more acidic

-ex HClO > HBrO > HIO

Lewis acid: acids accept electron-pairs, empty valence orbital -> acid
Lewis base: electron pair donors	
all Bronsted-Lowry bases are Lewis bases

#cations and anions
hydrolysis: reaction with water
anions are bases and cations are acids, hydrolysis proves
greater charge and smaller size make a cation more acidic
anion with conjugate strong acid does not affect pH
anion with weak acid conjugate -> increase pH
cation with weak base conjugate -> decrease pH

#titration
M1V1 = M2V2
acid   base

4 diff titration curves, graph of pH wrt titrant. Pairwise weak/strong acid/base. Polyprotic acid, w plural protons, two eq points.

base anhydried: metallic oxide forms basic solution
acid anhydried: non-metallic oxide forms acidic solution
