#city planning
reasons for city location
   water
   transportation
   climate and topography
   raw materials

#central place theory
created by Walter Christaller
oddly hexagon shaped, big center surrounded by smaller ones
intermediate centers on the edges, with sub-center nodes in-between.
market area, hinterland: area around service customers are from
range: distance traveled for service
threshold: minimum needed to support business
assumptions
    equal soil fertility
    flat land
    population distribution
    equal income
    equal transportation

#size of groupings
education trends with size
generally smaller towns still have elementary schools
difficult to distribute younger children
primate city rule: largest city twice as large as second
theorized by Mark Jefferson
-ex France, Paris 9m, Marseilles 1m
rank-size rule: nth largest, 1/n population 
theorized by Zipf
gravity model:interaction proportional to population, inverse to distance
hierarchy of services: larger places -> more + specialized services
high order service: specialized 
low order service: not

#urbanization
2008 UN, 50% live in urban areas 
mega-cities: 10 million people or more, ex-Mumbai, Shanghai + New York
5% live in mega-cities 
urban is defined differently by country, less req in developing
UN predicts 1.8% annual growth in urban, 2.3% in developing
