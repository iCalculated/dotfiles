## Urban Models

#### Concentric Zone Model *(1923)*

City grows outward from central area, via rings

Starting from core as follows:

1. businesses, high land value
2. deteriorated housing,factories
3. small single family homes
4. larger homes
5. suburbs

##### Key Concepts

* CBD is focal point, highest accessibility &rarr; land value.
* Intensive land use &rarr; vertical building.
* bid-rent theory: proximity to CBD &rarr; increase in price

#### Borchert's Epochs of Urbanization

1. Sail and Wagon *(1790-1830)*:  
    * NYC, Boston and Philadelphia 
    * at most 60 miles inland
2. Steamboat-Iron Horse *(1830-1860)*:
    * Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago
    * regional rails
    * steamboats still bourgeoisie 
3. Steel-Rail *(1870-1920)*:
    * Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas
    * lighter steel rail used
    * trains faster than steamboats &rarr; more popular
4. Automobile-Air *(1920-1970)*:
    * Sunbelt and Suburbs, hubs become even more central
    * air conditioner was invented in the same period
    * most people have cars
    * air travel is acessible towards end 
5. High Tech *(1970-present)*:
    * cars still exist, new tech though
