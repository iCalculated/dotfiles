## Urban Models

#### Concentric Zone Model *(1923)*

City grows outward from central area, via rings

Starting from core as follows:

1. businesses, high land value
2. deteriorated housing,factories
3. small single family homes
4. larger homes
5. suburbs

##### Key Concepts

* CBD is focal point, highest accessibility &rarr; land value.
* Intensive land use &rarr; vertical building.
* bid-rent theory: proximity to CBD &rarr; increase in price

#### Borchert's Epochs of Urbanization

1. Sail and Wagon *(1790-1830)*:  
    * NYC, Boston and Philadelphia 
    * at most 60 miles inland
2. Steamboat-Iron Horse *(1830-1860)*:
    * Pittsburgh, Detroit, Chicago
    * regional rails
    * steamboats still bourgeoisie 
3. Steel-Rail *(1870-1920)*:
    * Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas
    * lighter steel rail used
    * trains faster than steamboats &rarr; more popular
4. Automobile-Air *(1920-1970)*:
    * Sunbelt and Suburbs, hubs become even more central
    * air conditioner was invented in the same period
    * most people have cars
    * air travel is acessible towards end 
5. High Tech *(1970-present)*:
    * cars still exist, new tech though
    * high speed rail
    * internet can be used to procure services, general ridesharing

## Urban Problems

#### Terms
* racial covenant: putting racial exclusivity in development or renting temrs 

> Sometimes referred to as Jim Crow of the North.

* underclass: lowest social class, reasons include

* urban sprawl: spreading out over more land than otherwise needed. 

* brownfields:  abandoned areas where industry used to be

>> Example is the Ford Plan in St. Paul.

* filtering: the process of splittings single family homes

* redlining: refusing to provide loans based on address or race 

* urban heat island: human activity makes everything warmer

* greenbelts: reserved green areas, no developing

* urban infill: using unused landin cities

* smart growth: any policies that limit development and sprawl

>> signficant in NJ, RI, WA, TN and OR. Portland is most well known.

* exurbanism: leaving urban areas, same idea as counter-urbanism



#### Poverty

* $\frac{1}{6}$ live in urban poverty, most in developing countries.
* in LDCs squatters and favelas are generally on the edge of cities, inner city in MDCs.
* Generally takes about 20 years without unexpected costs to escape poverty.

Factors preventing people from leaving poverty:
    - expensive housing
    - underfunded schools &rarr; worse outcomes
    - low-pay low-skill jons
    - hard to get credit

Filtering happens when less-wealthy renters are available and the additional upkeep can lead to buildings being abandoned.

#### Urban Decay

* New technology decreases need for workers
* Zoning and lack of space prevents companies from making central factories &rarr; companies build factories in suburbs

#### Social and Cultural Problems

Housing:

- lack of affordable housing
- structural decay

Homelessness:

- cities don't want to admit conditions
- St. Paul got in trouble for sending homeless people away

Services:

- availbility

Food deserts:

- not having access to grocery stores
- function of transportation as well

Gender, race and ethnicity:

- cities have ethnic enclaves
- conflict

Gentrification:

- developing leads to higher prices



#### Political Issues

Public transportation:

- funding, can't all be covered by fares or people stop using it. Some funding from gas tax

Infrastructure:

- all forms of utility
- come from taxes

Informal Economy:

- ex- Uber, Lyft, AirBnB
- government has a hard time taxing
- often things start in informal, become formal with growth

Crime:

- somewhat inevitable with population density
- external also included, terrorism. Larger city &rarr; larger target

#### Environmental Issues

Urban canyons:

- buildings form wind tunnels where wind is channeled
- buildings can also block the sun

Wildlife:

- only certain pests take advantage of urban life
- cockroaches
- raccoons exploiting trash

Pollution:

- especially for suburbs, taking lots of space
- still significant in cities, not compact enough
- human existence in general 

#### Sustainable Development

Smart growth is utilized to prevent urban sprawl and other detriment from human expansion. All about optimizing use of land while also making communities interesting.
